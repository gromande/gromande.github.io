I am an Information Security generalist, currently focused on designing and implementing Identity and Access Management programs for my clients. I have a passion for finding simple strategies and solutions that can solve complex problems using a combination of technical skills and business acumen.

My innate curiosity for understanding how the world works is always driving me to meet new people and learn from others. I truly believe that the best way to improve yourself and be successful is to help others reach their goals, which is the main motivation behind this blog.

Born and raised in Spain, I now live in Chicago with my wife. I love traveling to remote places, sports (soccer, golf, rugby), foreign movies, and thought-provoking books.
